I am a student at the University of Houston Downtown. I am currently on track to graduate in 2024 with my bachelor’s degree 
                  in computer science. I enjoy learning so I will continue to keep learning even after I graduate by continuing reading books!

	          I am a first generation born in the United States. My family is from Honduras so that makes me a Latina.
		  My favorite color is blue and my favorite fruit is mango.

		  One of my favorite places I’ve been to is Switzerland and being able to see the Swiss alps with my parents. 
                  This is one of my favorite memories and will be one of the memories I cherish until I die. 
                  I enjoy eating food and some of the best food I’ve ever tried before is Peruvian food and argentian food. 
                  I visited multiple different countries in Europe including Germany, England, and Spain and each place 
                  I visited the argentian food was delicious. </strong></p>
